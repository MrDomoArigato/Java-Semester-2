My project revolves around inputting a sentence file and a dictionary file. Everything is done in a GUI
and anything sent through the console is just for testing purposes and has no interaction. The user
chooses their file through a File Chooser that is read by the program.

The sentence and dictionary are placed into separate ArrayLists that are later iterated through inside
a nested for loop checking for words that are the same. They are appended to the text area for user
to see words that are the same, and total counter of words is also taken to get the percentage.

The words are set to lower case from the sentence file for easier comparison with the dictionary.
The slang words that are found usually always mean the sentence is slang, the sentence is only ever formal
without these words being present. 

The dictionary can be edited by adding new words to it.
